### All algorithms implemented in Python 3 (for education)
There implementations are for learning purposes. If you want to contribute more efficient solutions feel free to open an issue and commit your solution.

## Inspiration

You can look for Algorithms to implement at: [LeetCode Algorithms](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/) 

To contribute make sure the Algorithm isn't commited yet! Make sure to add the number of the Issue in your PR.

## Contributing Guidelines

### Folders and Files
Please make sure your file is in the `LeetCode`-Folder and Named like this:
`0001_TwoSum.py` -> 4-digit Number of the LeetCode Issue, Underscore, LeetCodeName
